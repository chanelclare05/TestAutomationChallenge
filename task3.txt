You are a part of the team working on a new feature that rewards a player once a day when they start an application. As a Test Automator, you're asked to add test scenarios to acceptance specifications of this feature.

Please describe at least 2 happy path tests and at least 1 edge case test for this situation, then how you would automate them.
______________________________________________________________

Acceptance Specifications:

- The user must be logged in successfully
    - Happy Path Test
        - The user provides username and password, clicks sign in
        - The credentials are authenticated
        - The user is taken to the next screen/homepage 
- The account must be an active/valid account
    - Happy Path Test:
        - The account has the daily reward feature turned on
     *(just in case there are scenarios where some accounts do not qualify for the daily reward, A/B testing, etc)* 
    
- It must be the first session for user/account in that day
    - Happy Path Test:
        - The account has not been logged into/session had not been initialized yet that day
        - The account has not received the daily reward 
        - The daily reward is loaded to the account
        - The user is notified that the reward is loaded to account

In other words, the happy tests will test that the input/output from user/application has been fulfilled, happy test flow:
  1. The user provides username and password, clicks sign in -> test returns true/passed
  2. The credentials are authenticated -> test returns true/passed 
  3. The user is taken to the next screen/homepage -> test returns true/passed
  4. The account has the daily reward feature turned on -> test returns true/passed
  5. It is the first session for this account/user in the day -> test returns true/passed
  6. The account has not received the daily reward -> test returns true/passed
  7. The daily reward is loaded to the account -> test returns true/passed

Edge Case: 
The session crashes/refreshes between application verifying it is the first session and actually rewarding the account
  1. The edge case would have to check to see if the first session has occured and if there was a new daily reward provided in that day. If the first session had occured but there was no daily reward, then the application would provide a reward, even if it was the 7th session of the day for the user.

  Therefore, the test would override the intiial tests, and look at if a reward had been provided and at least one session had occured that day.
